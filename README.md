# Flight Fare Prediction

## üìù Overview
The Flight Fare Prediction project aims to predict airline ticket prices based on key features like origin, destination, distance, and airline. It combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and machine learning to build a predictive model. The project also includes a Flask-based web application that allows users to input flight details and receive fare predictions.

## üìä Dataset Sources & Description
This project uses flight data from the **Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)**:
- **Quarterly Flight Data**: Datasets are merged from four quarters of 2021. Each dataset contains detailed information such as miles flown, carrier codes, and fares.
- The dataset contains **42 columns** and **22 million rows** initially, which were reduced to **13 columns** and **7 million rows** after cleaning and preprocessing.
- **Source Link**: [BTS Dataset](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?gnoyr_VQ=FHK).

## üßπ Data Cleaning, Preprocessing and Key Features

1. **Dataset Merging**:
   - Combined quarterly datasets for 2022 into a single comprehensive dataset using pandas' `append()` function.
2. **Data Wrangling and Profiling**:
   - Removed unnecessary columns (e.g., `AirportGroup`, `DestCountry`) and renamed certain columns for better clarity.
   - Checked for missing values and ensured data consistency.
   - Reduced the dataset to **13 columns** and **7 million rows**.

   <img src="./images/data_profiling_3.png" alt="Profiling Step 3" width="800"/>

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features:
     - **Miles**: Derived from `MktMilesFlown`.
     - **PricePerTicket**: Calculated as the average fare per mile flown.
     - **NumTicketsOrdered**: Represents the number of passengers.

 The cleaned dataset was saved as `Cleaned_data.csv` for analysis and modeling.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Implements LightGBM for fare prediction due to its efficiency and speed.
   - Handles categorical features like airlines using encoding methods.
5. **Web Application**:
   - A Flask-based API that takes user input via JSON or a form and predicts ticket prices.
   - A responsive HTML form (`home.html`) allows users to interact with the model in a user-friendly way.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Workflow
The project used several machine learning algorithms to predict flight fares. Below are the steps:

### Model Training:
1. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing sets.
2. **Algorithms Used**:
   - **Random Forest Regressor**:
     - Achieved the best R¬≤ score of **0.294**, explaining 29.4% of the variance.

   - **Linear Regression**:
     - R¬≤ score of **0.1468**, indicating lower predictive power.
